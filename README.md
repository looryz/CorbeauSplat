# CorbeauSplat

**CorbeauSplat** is an all-in-one Gaussian Splatting automation tool designed specifically for **macOS Silicon** . It streamlines the entire workflow from raw video/images to a fully trained and viewable 3D scene (Gaussian Splat).

## 🚀 What it does

This application provides a unified Graphical User Interface (GUI) to orchestrate the following steps:
1.  **Project Management**: Automatically organizes your outputs into structured project folders with images, sparse data, and checkpoints.
2.  **Sparse Reconstruction**: Automates **COLMAP** feature extraction, matching, and mapping. Supports **Glomap** as a modern alternative mapper.
3.  **Undistortion**: Automatically undistorts images for optimal training quality.
4.  **Training**: Integrates **Brush** to train Gaussian Splats directly on your Mac.
    -   **Densification Control**: Includes presets (Fast, Standard, Aggressive) and advanced parameters.
    -   **Auto-Refine**: Resume training seamlessly from your last checkpoint.
5.  **Visualization**: Includes a built-in tab running **SuperSplat** for immediate local viewing and editing of your PLY files.
6.  **Single Image to 3D**: (Bonus) Uses **Apple ML Sharp** to generate a 3D model from a single 2D image.

It is designed to be "click-and-run", handling dependency checks, process management, and **session persistence** for you.

## ✍️ A Note from the Author

> This program was realized through **"vibecoding"** with the help of **Gemini 3 Pro**.
>
> It was originally created to facilitate the technical workflow for a documentary film titled **"Le Corbeau"**. I am not a professional developer; I simply needed to automate a complex process by gathering the tools I use daily: COLMAP, the Brush app, and SuperSplat. 
>
> I share this code in all humility. I didn't originally plan to release it, but I thought that perhaps someone, somewhere on this earth, might find it useful.
>
> As this software was built via "vibecoding" (AI-assisted coding), it is provided "as is" with no guarantees.

## 🛠 Prerequisites & Installation

### Requirements
- **macOS** (Silicon recommended)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (Required for compiling custom engines like Glomap or Brush)
- **Homebrew** (for installing system dependencies like COLMAP and FFmpeg)
- **Git**

### Installation
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CorbeauSplat.git
    cd CorbeauSplat
    ```

2.  Run the launcher:
    ```bash
    ./run.command
    ```
    *The script will automatically detect missing dependencies (Python packages, Brush, SuperSplat) and attempt to install them for you.*

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Configuration Tab**: 
    -   Select your input (Video or Folder of images).
    -   Define a **Project Name** (your files will be saved in `[Output Folder]/[Project Name]`).
    -   Click **"Create COLMAP Dataset"**.
2.  **Params Tab**: (Optional) Tweak advanced COLMAP settings or enable **Glomap**.
3.  **Brush Tab**: 
    -   **Auto-Refine**: Choose "Refine" mode to resume training from the latest checkpoint.
    -   **Presets**: Use specific densification strategies (e.g., "Aggressive Densification").
    -   Click **"Start Brush Training"**.
4.  **SuperSplat Tab**: 
    -   Load your trained `.ply` file.
    -   Click **"Start Servers"** to launch the viewer locally.

### ⌨️ Command Line Interface (CLI)
